\title{Rank genes based on how ubiquitous they are.}
\usage{
rank_genes(
  cross_sample_metric = "above_95",
  cross_sample_weight = 0.5,
  level_metric = "median_expression_normalized",
  level_weight = 0.25,
  variation_metric = "qcv_expression_normalized",
  variation_weight = -0.25
)
}
\value{
A \code{data.table} with gene data as well as the scores, ranks and
percentiles for each gene.
}
\description{
This function will compute a weighted average across multiple metrics that
define how ubiquitous a gene is based on its expression across samples.
